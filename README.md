2. What you’re creating?

* Team Vulcan is creating a custom RSA Encryption Messenger as a simple solution for secure private messaging accessible for everyone.

3. Who you’re doing it for, your audience (may be same as the previous question)?

* We are hopping that business and people trying to communicate  securely via the internet could use our system  

4. Why you’re doing this, the impact or change you hope to make?

* A lot of people don't understand how to encrypt their data, with this tool, we are trying to make it easy and secure

## Technologies

**RSA Encryption** :  is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. An RSA user creates and publishes a public key based on two large prime numbers, along with an auxiliary value. The prime numbers are kept secret. Messages can be encrypted by anyone, via the public key, but can only be decoded by someone who knows the prime numbers.

## Features

- **Features:** What will be the initial features in this first sprint.

- - **Give each feature a name.**
  - **Describe what it does and who or what uses it.**
  - **What user stories correspond to this feature.**

* Sprint 1: Encryption Algorithm
  1. To begin our project, we will need to create an Encryption Algorithm for simple messages.
  2. As a message app user, we would like an RSA messenger with a strong encryption sequence.

To-do list:

- Add padding to RSA
- Make desktop app



## Updates

### Sprint 1 - v0.01

​	**Nicodemus Robles** 

C++ RSA encryptor and decryptor - ./crypt

- This sprint I added  a C++ RSA encryptor and decryptor. In its current state, the program can only encrypt/decrypt hard coded int's and the key's aren't strong . 

I also added some RSA documents for reference.

      implemented the fermat primality test in python:  [fermat_primality.py](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s21vulcans/uss-enterprise/src/master/primes/fermat_primality.py)
