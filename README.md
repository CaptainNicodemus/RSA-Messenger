## Features

- **Features (25 pts):** What will be the initial features in this first sprint.

- - **Give each feature a name.**
  - **Describe what it does and who or what uses it.**
  - **What user stories correspond to this feature.**

* Sprint 1: Encryption Algorithm
	1. To begin our project, we will need to create an Ecryption Algorithm for simple messages.
	2. As a message app user, we would like an RSA messenger with a strong encryption sequence.

To-do list:

- Wow improvement to be done 1
- Wow improvement to be done 2
