## General info
1. Who you’re working with (you and your team members)?

> Team Members: Nicodemus Robles, Trey Tolleson, Mandi Renae Palencia, Roman Iles

2. What you’re creating?

* Team Vulcan is creating a custom RSA Encryption Messenger as a simple solution for secure private messaging accessible for everyone.

3. Who you’re doing it for, your audience (may be same as the previous question)?

* We are hopping that business and people trying to communicate  securely via the internet could use our system  

4. Why you’re doing this, the impact or change you hope to make?

* A lot of people don't understand how to encrypt their data, with this tool, we are trying to make it easy and secure

## Features

- **Features (25 pts):** What will be the initial features in this first sprint.

- - **Give each feature a name.**
  - **Describe what it does and who or what uses it.**
  - **What user stories correspond to this feature.**

* Sprint 1: Encryption Algorithm
	1. To begin our project, we will need to create an Ecryption Algorithm for simple messages.
	2. As a message app user, we would like an RSA messenger with a strong encryption sequence.

To-do list:

- Wow improvement to be done 1
- Wow improvement to be done 2
